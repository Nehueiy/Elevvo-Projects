ðŸ“ˆ Student Score Prediction â€“ ML Regression Project:
This project is part of my 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge with Elevvo Internship.
The goal is to predict students' exam scores based on the number of study hours using linear and polynomial regression.

ðŸŽ¯ Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering:
This project is part of my Elevvo 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge.
The goal is to segment mall customers into meaningful groups based on income, age, and spending behavior using K-Means Clustering.

ðŸŒ² Forest Cover Type Classifier:
A fast and efficient machine learning project that predicts the type of forest cover based on geographic and environmental features using the Random Forest algorithm.
This is part of my Elevvo Machine Learning Internship Projects ðŸŽ¯

ðŸŽ¶ Music Genre Classification ðŸŽ§:
This project explores different approaches to classify music genres using the GTZAN dataset.
Both machine learning on audio features and deep learning on spectrogram images are implemented to compare performance.
